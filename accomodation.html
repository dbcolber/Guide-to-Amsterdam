<h2>Hostels</h2>

<!--GENERATOR HOSTEL-->
<h3>The Generator Hostel</h3>

<body>
    The Generator is located right next to the beautiful Oosterpark in Amsterdam Oost. As far as hostels go, it is on the pricier side. Even so, it is a beautiful hostel in a great location that sells out quickly.

<!--ClinkNOORD HOSTEL-->
<h3>ClinkNOORD</h3>

<body>
    ClinkNOORD is a 5 minute ferry ride from the Amsterdam Centraal Station (the ferry runs all night). It is a cheaper option, but still high quality hostel. Several of my friends have stayed here and had great experiences!

<h2>Hotels</h2>

<!--VOLKSHOTEL-->
<h3>The Volkshotel</h3>

<body>
    The Volkshotel is in Amsterdam Oost and is located right across the street from where I stayed. It has a rooftop restaurant and bar with incredible views of the city. It even has rooftop hot tubs!

<!--THE STUDENT HOTEL-->
<h3>The Student Hotel</h3>

<body>
    The Student Hotel Amsterdam City is where I stayed during my four months in Amsterdam. The hotel has a section for students staying long-term, and a separate section of the hotel for guests of all ages. The hotel side can be a bit pricey, but the interior is stunning. You definitely get Amsterdam's unique design vibes.
