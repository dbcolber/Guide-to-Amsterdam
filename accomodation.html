<h2>Hostels</h2>

<!--GENERATOR HOSTEL-->
<h3>The Generator Hostel</h3>

<body>
    The Generator is located right next to the beautiful Oosterpark in Amsterdam Oost. As far as hostels go, it is on the pricier side. Even so, it is a beautiful hostel in a great location that sells out quickly.

<!--ClinkNOORD HOSTEL-->
<h3>ClinkNOORD</h3>

<body>
    ClinkNOORD is a 5 minute ferry ride from the Amsterdam Centraal Station (the ferry runs all night). It is a cheaper option, but still high quality hostel. Several of my friends have stayed here and had great experiences!
