    Welcome! My name is Danielle and I am a UX Design student at the University of Michiganâ€™s School of Information. During the spring of 2018 I studied abroad at the Vrije University in Amsterdam. Feel free to check out my recommendations for accommodation, activities, and food. There is also a guide to each of the major neighborhoods in the city.
